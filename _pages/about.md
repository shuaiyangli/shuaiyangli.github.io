I'm a second year PhD candidate from [Hefei University of Technology (HFUT)](http://www.hfut.edu.cn/). Before that, I received the M.S. degree from [Northeast Electric Power University (NEEPU)](http://www.neepu.edu.cn/) in 2018 and the B.E. degree from [Henan Normal University (HNU)](https://www.htu.edu.cn/) in 2014. My research interests include information retrieval, data mining, and multimedia analytics.
